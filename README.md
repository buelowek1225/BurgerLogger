## Eat-Da-Burger

**Project:** Eat-Da-Burger
**Goal of this Project:** Welcome to Eat-Da-Burger! This restaurant app allows users to input the names of the burgers they'd like to eat. 

**Created by:** Ellen Buelow

**Directions:** Eat-Da-Burger allows users to input the names of the burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, that burger will dispaly the NEW burger name on the left side of the page (waiting to be DEVOURED). Each burger added to the waiting area has a devour it button. When the user clicks it the burger will move to right side of the page. Ever burger created will be added to the database (devoured or not).
